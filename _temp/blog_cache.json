I\u2019ve got a hot take for you today, something that\u2019s been brewing as I watch the AI landscape evolve: <strong>I think the breakneck, exponential growth we\u2019ve celebrated in AI, especially with Large Language Models (LLMs), is hitting a\u00a0plateau.</strong></p><p>No, I don\u2019t mean AI is dead or that progress has stopped. But the <em>nature</em> of that progress? It\u2019s changing.

Gordon Moore\u2019s famous observation that computer chips seemed to double in transistor count (and roughly, performance) every couple of years, while costs halved? It drove decades of innovation.

Let\u2019s explore the signs that LLM progress is slowing, why simply scaling isn\u2019t the magic bullet anymore, and what this really means for startups navigating the\u00a0future.</p><h3>The Echo of Moore\u2019s Law: We\u2019ve Seen This Movie\u00a0Before</h3><p>Before we dive into AI specifics, let\u2019s quickly recall Moore\u2019s Law. For decades, it was a reliable engine of progress. Buy a computer, wait a few years, and the next one would be significantly more powerful for the same (or less) money. But around the 2010s, that curve noticeably flattened. We hit physical barriers\u200a\u2014\u200atransistors could only get so small, heat became a problem, and the cost of building next-gen fabs skyrocketed. Improvement didn\u2019t stop, but it shifted towards specialized chips (like GPUs, or Apple\u2019s efficiency/performance cores) and clever software optimization, rather than just raw, exponential CPU power\u00a0gains.</p><p>This pattern\u200a\u2014\u200arapid, seemingly unstoppable growth followed by a necessary shift in strategy due to inherent limits\u200a\u2014\u200ais a classic technology lifecycle. And AI, particularly the LLM approach, might be entering its own version of this\u00a0phase.</p><h3>Spotting the Plateau: Reading the AI Tea\u00a0Leaves</h3><p>So why do I think the LLM rocket is losing some of its initial thrust? The evidence is mounting:</p><ol><li><strong>Diminishing Benchmark Returns:</strong> Remember those charts comparing GPT-3.5 to GPT-4? Huge leap. Now look at the progress from GPT-4 to GPT-4 Turbo, or to the newer GPT-4o, or Claude 2 to Claude 3 Opus/Sonnet, or Gemini releases. Yes, they\u2019re better, but the <em>gap</em> is shrinking. We\u2019re seeing companies throw exponentially <em>more</em> money, compute power (often measured in trillions of operations per second), and unfathomably vast amounts of data at these models, yet the performance gains on benchmarks are becoming incremental, not revolutionary. We\u2019re pushing harder on the pedals, but the acceleration is\u00a0slowing.</li><li><strong>Stagnation in Key Applications:</strong> Let\u2019s be honest about real-world utility. Think about image and video generation. A year or two ago, the progress was astounding. Now? While improvements continue, much of the output is still what I\u2019d call <strong>\u2018mostly unusable media\u2019</strong> for professional contexts without significant editing. It often feels uncanny, slightly off, or requires very specific prompting to get something decent. The practical, reliable application isn\u2019t keeping pace with the benchmark hype.</li><li><strong>Expert Opinions Shifting:</strong> When figures like Yann LeCun\u200a\u2014\u200aa godfather of AI and head of AI research at Meta, responsible for Llama\u200a\u2014\u200aexplicitly advises students interested in <em>next-generation</em> AI to <strong>\u201cnot work on LLMs\u201d</strong> because they have limitations, it\u2019s worth listening. He argues for focusing on entirely new architectures. This echoes the famous \u201cBitter Lesson\u201d in AI research: historically, trying to meticulously bake human knowledge into systems often gets outperformed by more general methods that leverage massive compute. But what happens when the returns on simply adding <em>more</em> compute start to diminish?</li><li><strong>Industry Signals:</strong> Even the language used by AI companies is telling. Mistral AI, a major open-source player, called their latest flagship model <strong>\u201cMistral Large 2\u201d</strong> but headlined the announcement <strong>\u201cLarge Enough.\u201d</strong> It\u2019s subtle, but it signals a potential shift\u200a\u2014\u200amaybe the race isn\u2019t just about being the <em>biggest</em>\u00a0anymore.</li></ol><h3>The Big Nuance: Democratization &amp; The Rise of \u201cGood Enough\u201d\u00a0AI</h3><p>Now, hold on. This plateau doesn\u2019t mean the AI party is over. Far from it. While the <em>peak capability</em> of the absolute state-of-the-art models might be seeing diminishing returns from scaling alone, something crucial is happening: <strong>democratization.</strong></p><p>We\u2019re seeing incredibly powerful <strong>open-source models, like DeepSeek</strong> and others from Mistral and Meta (Llama), become not just available, but highly competitive and <strong>way less expensive</strong> to run than the closed, flagship models from giants like OpenAI or Anthropic.</p><p>This changes the game. The competitive advantage is shifting. It might no longer be about having exclusive access to the absolute biggest, baddest model that costs millions to train and run. Instead, the opportunity lies\u00a0in:</p><ul><li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Finding models that provide 80\u201390% of the capability for a fraction of the cost and\u00a0compute.</li><li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Leveraging powerful open-source tools that level the playing field for startups.</li><li><strong>Application:</strong> Building clever, valuable products and services <em>on top</em> of these \u201cgood enough\u201d\u00a0models.</li></ul><p>The revolution continues, but it\u2019s shifting from pure capability breakthroughs at the peak to broader usability and efficiency across the\u00a0board.</p><h3>Founders: It\u2019s Time to Question the\u00a0Hype</h3><p>So, as a startup founder, especially if you\u2019re not deep in the AI weeds technically, what\u2019s the takeaway?</p><ul><li><strong>Question the Hype:</strong> Be skeptical of claims of endless exponential improvement. Understand the difference between benchmark scores and real-world, reliable\u00a0utility.</li><li><strong>Temper Expectations:</strong> Don\u2019t bank your entire business model on the assumption that an AI model arriving next year will magically solve all your problems or be 10x better than\u00a0today\u2019s.</li><li><strong>Focus on Smart Application:</strong> The real wins will likely come from applying <em>current</em>, often open-source, AI technology in novel and efficient ways to solve genuine customer problems, not just chasing the bleeding edge of model size. How can you use <em>today\u2019s</em> tools more effectively?</li><li><strong>Think Efficiency &amp; Cost:</strong> As compute becomes a bottleneck for scaling the giants, efficiency becomes <em>your</em> advantage. Explore smaller, fine-tuned, or open-source models that deliver the value you need without breaking the\u00a0bank.</li><li><strong>Look Beyond LLMs:</strong> Keep an eye on alternative approaches. While LLMs are powerful, remember LeCun\u2019s point\u200a\u2014\u200athe next <em>major</em> leaps might come from different architectures entirely (like the analog AI chips IBM is researching, or other specialized hardware and software).</li></ul><h3>The End of an Era, The Start of\u2026\u00a0What?</h3><p>Just like Moore\u2019s Law didn\u2019t mean the end of computing progress, this AI plateau doesn\u2019t mean the end of AI innovation. It signals the potential end of <em>one specific era</em>\u200a\u2014\u200athe era defined by the seemingly limitless scaling of LLMs via brute-force compute and\u00a0data.</p><p>We\u2019re likely moving into a new phase. One focused more on architectural diversity, algorithmic efficiency, clever application, and the democratization of powerful, \u201cgood enough\u201d AI through accessible open-source models.

I think so. And the founders who grasp that shift, question the hype, and focus on real-world value creation will be the ones who truly thrive in the next chapter of\u00a0AI.</p><p><em>What do you think?

You know you need a community around it\u200a\u2014\u200aa place for users to connect, ask questions, give feedback, and become loyal\u00a0fans.</p><p>But you\u2019re a startup. Time is precious, resources are tight, and maybe coding a whole forum isn\u2019t exactly top of your skillset or priority list. You need a community hub, like, <em>yesterday</em>.</p><p>Sound familiar? If so, you\u2019re in the right place. There\u2019s a powerful, widely-used tool called <strong>Discourse</strong> that can help you build that thriving online community <em>without</em> the headache.</p><p>This post will explain exactly what Discourse is (in plain English!) and why it\u2019s a fantastic, time-saving option for startups and non-technical people who want to foster connection and engagement.</p><h3>What Exactly Is Discourse? (No Geek-Speak Required!)</h3><p>Think of Discourse as a <strong>modern, super-powered online forum</strong> or discussion platform. It\u2019s designed from the ground up for civilized, engaging conversations on the internet today. Forget those clunky, outdated forums of the past; Discourse is smooth, intuitive, and packed with features users actually enjoy\u00a0using.</p><h3>It\u2019s Everywhere (Seriously!)</h3><p>You might be surprised how many places you\u2019ve already seen Discourse in action. As mentioned on their site, <strong>over 22,000 companies</strong>, from small startups to huge enterprises, use it to power their communities. Big names and niche groups alike rely on\u00a0it.</p><p>Why? Because it works, it\u2019s reliable, and it helps build real connections. Seeing it used so widely should give you confidence that it\u2019s a solid\u00a0choice.</p><h3>The \u201cOpen Source\u201d Advantage (Simply\u00a0Put)</h3><p>Discourse is <strong>\u201copen source.\u201d</strong> Without getting technical, this basically means its underlying code is publicly available and built collaboratively by a large community. For you, this translates to a few key benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> While you can use it easily out-of-the-box, it <em>can</em> be customized down the line if\u00a0needed.</li><li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Often, open-source projects have active communities helping each other\u00a0out.</li><li><strong>Cost-Effective Options:</strong> It allows for different ways to use the software, including affordable hosted plans and potentially free self-hosting (if you have the technical know-how).</li></ul><h3>Why Your Startup Should Seriously Consider Discourse (The Big Benefits)</h3><p>Okay, so it\u2019s a modern forum platform. But why is it specifically great for <em>your</em> startup? Let\u2019s break down the key advantages:</p><h3>Benefit 1: Get Your Community Hub Up\u00a0Fast</h3><p>This is huge. You don\u2019t need to build a community platform from scratch. Discourse provides everything you need. Especially if you opt for their official hosting, <strong>setup is incredibly straightforward</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200athey handle the technical heavy lifting. Less setup time means your community can launch faster, start growing sooner, and provide value immediately.</p><h3>Benefit 2: It Feels Modern &amp; Keeps People\u00a0Engaged</h3><p>Discourse isn\u2019t just functional; it\u2019s <strong>enjoyable to use</strong>. It includes features that users expect from modern web applications:</p><ul><li>Real-time updates and notifications</li><li>Easy @mentions to tag\u00a0users</li><li>Likes and badges to encourage participation</li><li>Simple posting and formatting tools</li><li>A clean, <strong>mobile-friendly design</strong> that works great on any\u00a0device</li></ul><p>This modern feel encourages people to stick around and participate, unlike older, clunkier forum software that can feel like a chore to\u00a0use.</p><h3>Benefit 3: You Can Actually Manage It (No Coding Degree\u00a0Needed!)</h3><p>Worried about managing the day-to-day? Discourse has a <strong>user-friendly administration dashboard</strong> designed for clarity. You can\u00a0easily:</p><ul><li>Manage users and permissions</li><li>Moderate discussions to keep things positive and\u00a0on-topic</li><li>Customize basic settings and appearance</li></ul><p>The moderation tools are simple but effective, helping you maintain a healthy community environment without needing deep technical expertise.</p><h3>Benefit 4: A Solution That Grows With\u00a0You</h3><p>Start small, dream big. Discourse can handle communities of all sizes. Whether you have ten users on day one or thousands down the road, the <strong>platform is built to scale</strong>. And because it\u2019s flexible, you <em>can</em> add integrations or customizations later if your needs evolve (though the standard features cover most use cases brilliantly).</p><h3>Benefit 5: Cost-Effective Options Available</h3><p>Discourse offers\u00a0choices:</p><ul><li><strong>Official Hosting:</strong> Plans tailored for different needs, starting at reasonable price points. This is the <em>easiest</em> path, especially for non-technical teams, as they handle all the infrastructure, updates, and maintenance. You pay for convenience and peace of\u00a0mind.</li><li><strong>Self-Hosting:</strong> If you (or someone on your team) are comfortable with server management, you can host Discourse yourself. This can be cheaper (or even free, besides server costs) but requires technical skill and ongoing maintenance effort.</li></ul><p>For most startups prioritizing speed and ease, the official hosted plans offer fantastic value.</p><h3>How Do You Get Started? (The Easy\u00a0Paths)</h3><p>Ready to explore further? Getting started with Discourse is simpler than you might think. Here are the main\u00a0options:</p><ol><li><strong>Official Discourse Hosting:</strong> This is the <strong>highly recommended route for most startups and non-technical users.</strong> Visit the <a href=\"https://www.discourse.org/\">official Discourse website</a> and check out their hosting plans (<em>insert specific pricing page link here</em>). They manage the technical side (setup, updates, security, backups), so you can focus purely on building your community. It\u2019s designed to be straightforward.</li><li><strong>Self-Hosting:</strong> If you have technical resources, you can download the open-source code and host it yourself. This gives you maximum control but comes with the responsibility of setup, maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting. Look for their installation guides if this path interests you.</li></ol><blockquote><strong><em>Don\u2019t be intimidated!

You know you need a community around it\u200a\u2014\u200aa place for users to connect, ask questions, give feedback, and become loyal\u00a0fans.</p><p>But you\u2019re a startup. Time is precious, resources are tight, and maybe coding a whole forum isn\u2019t exactly top of your skillset or priority list. You need a community hub, like, <em>yesterday</em>.</p><p>Sound familiar? If so, you\u2019re in the right place. There\u2019s a powerful, widely-used tool called <strong>Discourse</strong> that can help you build that thriving online community <em>without</em> the headache.</p><p>This post will explain exactly what Discourse is (in plain English!) and why it\u2019s a fantastic, time-saving option for startups and non-technical people who want to foster connection and engagement.</p><h3>What Exactly Is Discourse? (No Geek-Speak Required!)</h3><p>Think of Discourse as a <strong>modern, super-powered online forum</strong> or discussion platform. It\u2019s designed from the ground up for civilized, engaging conversations on the internet today. Forget those clunky, outdated forums of the past; Discourse is smooth, intuitive, and packed with features users actually enjoy\u00a0using.</p><h3>It\u2019s Everywhere (Seriously!)</h3><p>You might be surprised how many places you\u2019ve already seen Discourse in action. As mentioned on their site, <strong>over 22,000 companies</strong>, from small startups to huge enterprises, use it to power their communities. Big names and niche groups alike rely on\u00a0it.</p><p>Why? Because it works, it\u2019s reliable, and it helps build real connections. Seeing it used so widely should give you confidence that it\u2019s a solid\u00a0choice.</p><h3>The \u201cOpen Source\u201d Advantage (Simply\u00a0Put)</h3><p>Discourse is <strong>\u201copen source.\u201d</strong> Without getting technical, this basically means its underlying code is publicly available and built collaboratively by a large community. For you, this translates to a few key benefits:</p><ul><li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> While you can use it easily out-of-the-box, it <em>can</em> be customized down the line if\u00a0needed.</li><li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Often, open-source projects have active communities helping each other\u00a0out.</li><li><strong>Cost-Effective Options:</strong> It allows for different ways to use the software, including affordable hosted plans and potentially free self-hosting (if you have the technical know-how).</li></ul><h3>Why Your Startup Should Seriously Consider Discourse (The Big Benefits)</h3><p>Okay, so it\u2019s a modern forum platform. But why is it specifically great for <em>your</em> startup? Let\u2019s break down the key advantages:</p><h3>Benefit 1: Get Your Community Hub Up\u00a0Fast</h3><p>This is huge. You don\u2019t need to build a community platform from scratch. Discourse provides everything you need. Especially if you opt for their official hosting, <strong>setup is incredibly straightforward</strong>\u200a\u2014\u200athey handle the technical heavy lifting. Less setup time means your community can launch faster, start growing sooner, and provide value immediately.</p><h3>Benefit 2: It Feels Modern &amp; Keeps People\u00a0Engaged</h3><p>Discourse isn\u2019t just functional; it\u2019s <strong>enjoyable to use</strong>. It includes features that users expect from modern web applications:</p><ul><li>Real-time updates and notifications</li><li>Easy @mentions to tag\u00a0users</li><li>Likes and badges to encourage participation</li><li>Simple posting and formatting tools</li><li>A clean, <strong>mobile-friendly design</strong> that works great on any\u00a0device</li></ul><p>This modern feel encourages people to stick around and participate, unlike older, clunkier forum software that can feel like a chore to\u00a0use.</p><h3>Benefit 3: You Can Actually Manage It (No Coding Degree\u00a0Needed!)</h3><p>Worried about managing the day-to-day? Discourse has a <strong>user-friendly administration dashboard</strong> designed for clarity. You can\u00a0easily:</p><ul><li>Manage users and permissions</li><li>Moderate discussions to keep things positive and\u00a0on-topic</li><li>Customize basic settings and appearance</li></ul><p>The moderation tools are simple but effective, helping you maintain a healthy community environment without needing deep technical expertise.</p><h3>Benefit 4: A Solution That Grows With\u00a0You</h3><p>Start small, dream big. Discourse can handle communities of all sizes. Whether you have ten users on day one or thousands down the road, the <strong>platform is built to scale</strong>. And because it\u2019s flexible, you <em>can</em> add integrations or customizations later if your needs evolve (though the standard features cover most use cases brilliantly).</p><h3>Benefit 5: Cost-Effective Options Available</h3><p>Discourse offers\u00a0choices:</p><ul><li><strong>Official Hosting:</strong> Plans tailored for different needs, starting at reasonable price points. This is the <em>easiest</em> path, especially for non-technical teams, as they handle all the infrastructure, updates, and maintenance. You pay for convenience and peace of\u00a0mind.</li><li><strong>Self-Hosting:</strong> If you (or someone on your team) are comfortable with server management, you can host Discourse yourself. This can be cheaper (or even free, besides server costs) but requires technical skill and ongoing maintenance effort.</li></ul><p>For most startups prioritizing speed and ease, the official hosted plans offer fantastic value.</p><h3>How Do You Get Started? (The Easy\u00a0Paths)</h3><p>Ready to explore further? Getting started with Discourse is simpler than you might think. Here are the main\u00a0options:</p><ol><li><strong>Official Discourse Hosting:</strong> This is the <strong>highly recommended route for most startups and non-technical users.</strong> Visit the <a href=\"https://www.discourse.org/\">official Discourse website</a> and check out their hosting plans (<em>insert specific pricing page link here</em>). They manage the technical side (setup, updates, security, backups), so you can focus purely on building your community. It\u2019s designed to be straightforward.</li><li><strong>Self-Hosting:</strong> If you have technical resources, you can download the open-source code and host it yourself. This gives you maximum control but comes with the responsibility of setup, maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting. Look for their installation guides if this path interests you.</li></ol><blockquote><strong><em>Don\u2019t be intimidated! The hosted option truly simplifies the process, making a powerful community platform accessible to everyone.</em></strong></blockquote><h3>Conclusion: Build Your Community Faster &amp; Smarter with Discourse</h3><p>Stop letting the challenge of building community software slow you down.
