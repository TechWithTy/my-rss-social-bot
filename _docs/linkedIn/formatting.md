Our text formatter utilizes Unicode symbols to format text since LinkedIn doesn't support native text formatting. When you input text into the tool, it transforms your text to appear bold, italicized, or underlined.

- **Draw attention** to key points in your posts.
- Improve readability and engagement.
- Enhance the aesthetics of your LinkedIn post and profile.

However, it's crucial to remember that formatted text isn't searchable on LinkedIn. It may not display universally on all devices and isn't accessible by screen-readers.
